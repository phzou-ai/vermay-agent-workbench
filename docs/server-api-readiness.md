# Server/API Readiness

## Current Position

The server is now A2A-first for external service access.

The old local lifecycle REST surface under `/api/sessions` and `/api/tasks` has been removed. The remaining `/api` routes are main-agent management and Web UI diagnostics, not the public task execution boundary.

Start the server:

```bash
vermay-agent serve --enable-a2a
```

Use deterministic development responders for protocol smoke tests and the Web UI:

```bash
vermay-agent serve --enable-a2a --dev-mock-main-agent
```

Default bind address:

```text
127.0.0.1:8000
```

The server is local-only by default and does not add authentication. Do not expose it outside a trusted environment without an access-control layer.

## Public Service Boundary

Current A2A-first public routes:

```text
GET  /health
GET  /.well-known/agent-card.json
POST /rpc
POST /message:send
POST /message:stream
GET  /tasks/{task_id}
POST /tasks/{task_id}:subscribe
POST /tasks/{task_id}:cancel
```

Prefer `/rpc` for new clients. Path-style A2A routes remain operational for compatibility, but they are deprecated for new first-party client work and should not be removed without a dedicated cleanup milestone.

Current compatibility routes kept for burn-in:

```text
POST /message:send
POST /message:stream
GET  /tasks/{task_id}
POST /tasks/{task_id}:subscribe
POST /tasks/{task_id}:cancel
```

Known first-party compatibility usage includes backend smoke tests, backend compatibility tests, and current child-agent delegation in `vermay_agent/main_agent/remote_agent.py`.

## JSON-RPC Methods

`POST /rpc` supports one JSON-RPC request object per HTTP request.

Supported canonical methods:

```text
SendMessage
SendStreamingMessage
GetTask
CancelTask
SubscribeToTask
```

Transitional aliases remain accepted during burn-in, but canonical method names should be used for new callers:

```text
message/send
message/stream
tasks/get
tasks/cancel
tasks/subscribe
```

Batch arrays are intentionally rejected until single-request usage has completed one review and burn-in pass.

## Identity Model

The main-agent service separates conversation context from execution lifecycle:

```text
contextId
  long-lived conversation/context container

taskId
  single task execution started by one user input

thread_id
  internal LangGraph checkpoint key for local task execution
```

`thread_id` is runtime state. It must not become the public task identity.

## Send Message

Local message response:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/rpc \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "req-message-1",
    "method": "SendMessage",
    "params": {
      "message": {
        "kind": "message",
        "role": "user",
        "messageId": "msg-message-1",
        "parts": [{"kind": "text", "text": "summarize current status"}]
      },
      "metadata": {"executionMode": "message"}
    }
  }'
```

Task response:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/rpc \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "req-task-1",
    "method": "SendMessage",
    "params": {
      "message": {
        "kind": "message",
        "role": "user",
        "messageId": "msg-task-1",
        "parts": [{"kind": "text", "text": "debug service health"}]
      },
      "metadata": {"executionMode": "task"}
    }
  }'
```

Route mode is controlled by `metadata.executionMode`:

```text
auto
message
task
```

Registered child-agent routing can be requested with route metadata such as `targetAgentId`.

## Task Get

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/rpc \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"req-get-1","method":"GetTask","params":{"id":"<task-id>"}}'
```

Path-style compatibility remains available for existing callers, but new clients should use `/rpc` `GetTask`:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks/<task-id>
```

## Task Events

Subscribe through `/rpc`:

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/rpc \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"req-subscribe-1","method":"SubscribeToTask","params":{"id":"<task-id>","afterEventId":0}}'
```

Path-style compatibility remains available for existing callers, but new clients should use `/rpc` `SubscribeToTask`:

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks/<task-id>:subscribe
```

SSE streams replay persisted task events and then stop at terminal task state.

Expected SSE event names:

```text
task
status-update
artifact-update
error
```

Streams do not expose raw graph state, raw prompts, raw model output, or full tool output.

## Task Cancel

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/rpc \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"req-cancel-1","method":"CancelTask","params":{"id":"<task-id>","reason":"operator requested"}}'
```

Path-style compatibility remains available for existing callers, but new clients should use `/rpc` `CancelTask`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks/<task-id>:cancel \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"reason":"operator requested"}'
```

Terminal tasks return `invalid_session_state` when cancellation is no longer allowed.

## Main-Agent Management API

The `/api` prefix is reserved for Web UI management and diagnostics:

```text
GET    /api/contexts
GET    /api/contexts/{context_id}
GET    /api/contexts/{context_id}/messages
GET    /api/contexts/{context_id}/tasks
GET    /api/contexts/{context_id}/route-decisions
GET    /api/contexts/{context_id}/delegations
DELETE /api/contexts/{context_id}?force=true
GET    /api/registered-agents
POST   /api/registered-agents
GET    /api/registered-agents/{agent_id}
POST   /api/registered-agents/{agent_id}/refresh-card
DELETE /api/registered-agents/{agent_id}
```

These routes are not the public A2A service boundary. Browser clients should access them through the Next.js BFF.

## Error Mapping

JSON-RPC errors preserve the caller-provided `id` and expose local error codes in `error.data.localCode`.

The response also includes `error.data.errorInfo` as a bridge toward A2A / google.rpc.ErrorInfo-style details:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req-1",
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "JSON-RPC params.message.role must be 'user'.",
    "data": {
      "localCode": "invalid_request",
      "errorInfo": {
        "reason": "invalid_request",
        "domain": "vermay-agent",
        "metadata": {
          "localCode": "invalid_request"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Current mapping:

```text
invalid_request        -> 400 / -32602
session_not_found      -> 404 / -32004
task_not_found         -> 404 / -32004
artifact_not_found     -> 404 / -32004
permission_error       -> 403 / -32003
invalid_session_state  -> 409 / -32009
other agent error      -> mapped by local error info
```

## Projection Boundaries

A2A projections include public task/message/status/artifact data only.

They must not expose:

```text
raw LangGraph state
raw prompts
raw model output
full tool output
internal checkpoint payloads
private trace details
```

Local artifact and output metadata determines whether artifacts are projectable to A2A.

## Verification

Backend gate:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Deterministic smoke gate:

```bash
BFF_URL=http://localhost:3000 scripts/a2a_dev_smoke.sh
```

The smoke script covers both `/rpc` and path-style compatibility routes while deprecation-only burn-in continues.

## Current Boundaries

- `/rpc` supports single-request JSON-RPC only.
- JSON-RPC batch requests are rejected.
- Path-style A2A routes remain operational compatibility routes, but they are deprecated for new first-party client work.
- Retry/resume are not currently reintroduced as public A2A routes.
- The local default server has no authentication.
